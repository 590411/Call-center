 ### Data sources
 ---

*The dataset use for this analysis is "Call Center_Dataset.csv"  file . we have data on sentiment ,csat_score reason channel etc*


### Tools
---
  - Excel: Data cleaning
  - Excel-pivot tables
  - Excel-Charts
  - Excel-slicers
      - [Download Excel here](https://microsoft.com)

### Data cleaning 
---
-Create a duplicate sheet as back up in case you need to have a view on the original dataset

-Enlarge all the columns that has data for visibility reasons 

-Make a distinction between the headers row and the rest using the cell style

-Freeze the top row , to make it always visible on the screen when scrolling down using freeze panes

-Check the number of data you have in your dataset , by placing the cursor on the main row of the dataset and press Ctrl + â†“ and to go back to the first row press Ctrl + â†‘

-Data type checking :

	  * for the csat_score and call duration in minutes columns ,change the data type to number
	  * for the call_timestamp column use the text to column function to harmonized the date
	  * Leave the other columns as there are , as they  are text


### Exploratory data analysis
---

EDA involved exploring  the call center data to  answer key question , such as :

  - What is the total inbound contacts for the month ?
  - what are the reasons for calls?
  - what is the number of contact per call center ?
  - what is the number of contact per channel  ?

### Data analysis
---

```
- AS the data is just for one month , we need to create a another column for the call day by using the function  date and then change data type to number and zero decimal number to have the call day

-Create a new sheet , to create  a pivot tables :
	* Calls by sentiment
	* Reasons for call
	* Calls by Channel
	* Calls by call center
	* Calls by response time
	* Calls by call day
	* Calls by state
	* Sentiment by call center
	* Response time by call center

- Create a new sheet for our dashboard ,The dashboard will be compose of the following element
	*  Slicers for call day
	*  Doughnut charts for Calls by Channel
	*  clustered bar chart for Calls by sentiment
	*  clustered bar chart for sentiments by call center
	*  Clustered column chart for calls by call center
	*  Clustered column chart for  Reasons for call
	*  Clustered column chart for Calls by response time
	*  Map of Calls by state
	*  Clustered column chart Calls by Channel

-Links the slicers to all the pivot charts and tables for the interactivity
	
```

### Findings
---

- In the overall , for the month of October 2020 ;
	* We had a total inbound contact of  32,941 
	* Most clients call in order to have more clarity on billing issues
